# DSX Exchange

DSX Exchange is a monorepo for the DSX Event Bus and Agentgateway, including
schemas, services, Helm charts, and local evaluation tooling.

Documentation for DSX Exchange is available at [https://docs.nvidia.com/dsx-exchange](https://docs.nvidia.com/dsx-exchange).

## Overview

DSX Exchange includes:

- `schemas`: AsyncAPI contracts for DSX Exchange MQTT topics and payloads.
- `auth-callout`: NATS auth callout service for OAuth2, mTLS, NKey, and no-auth profiles.
- `dsx-agentgateway-bridge`: MCP discovery and request routing over NATS.
- `deploy`: Helm charts for the NATS event bus and Agentgateway.
- `local`: Kind-based local evaluation environment, Skaffold deployment, MQTT and MCP tests, and benchmark tooling.

The event bus itself is schema agnostic. Schemas document externally visible contracts; NATS and the auth callout enforce routing, federation, and authorization behavior.

Upstream Agentgateway routes authenticated MCP requests to local MCP servers.
The `dsx-agentgateway-bridge` adds remote discovery and request routing over the
DSX Event Bus.

## Requirements

- OS: Linux or macOS with Docker support.
- Tools: `mise`, `make`, and Docker. Mise installs the remaining tools from the
  locked root toolchain.
- Kubernetes: a local Kind cluster for e2e testing.
- Runtime: Go modules use the Go version pinned in `mise.toml`.

GPU drivers are not required.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, install the local e2e prerequisites, and run the local
validation checks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/dsx-exchange.git
cd dsx-exchange
mise install --locked
make test
```

If you already have a DSX Event Bus and need to build or test an MQTT
integration application, start with the
[Integrator Quickstart](https://docs.nvidia.com/dsx-exchange/integrator-quickstart).

To deploy or integrate with DSX Agent Gateway, start with the
[DSX Agent Gateway overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/dsx-exchange/agent-gateway/overview).

Publish looping dummy BMS data into the local CSC MQTT broker:

```bash
make dummy-bms
```

## Usage

Use the top-level Makefile for repository workflows:

```bash
make help
make check
make test
```

After the local Kind environment is deployed, run the dummy BMS demo with
`make dummy-bms`.

## Performance

`make test` includes smoke-sized Event Bus and Agent Gateway performance
validation suitable for Kind.

Run the Event Bus benchmark directly:

```bash
go -C local/mqttbs run ./cmd/mqttbs run basic-suite \
  --broker tcp://172.18.200.1:1883
```

See [local/mqttbs/README.md](local/mqttbs/README.md) for smoke-sized options.
